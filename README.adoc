= Plugin Demo to demonstrate Issue #4995

This repository contains a example plugin which build is encapsulated by an grade build config to have it encapsulated to run within CI systems.


== Demonstrate / reproduce the problem

Try to run the demo application on android with:

* Install native script: `npm install -g nativescript`

```
cd plugin/src
npm run demo.android
```

=== Error message

The error message expected is:

```
....

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Project directory '/Users/sample/tmp/pluginseed/plugin/demo/platforms/tempPlugin/nativescript_yourplugin' is not part of the build defined by settings file '/Users/markus/tmp/pluginseed/settings.gradle'. If this is an unrelated build, it must have its own settings file.

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output. Run with --scan to get full insights.

* Get more help at https://help.gradle.org
